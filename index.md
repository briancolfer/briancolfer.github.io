# Ship faster with confidence
I help engineering teams cut release cycles from weeks to days by automating CI/CD (GitLab/Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab Pipelines), modernizing Kubernetes deployments, and embedding quality into pipelines.

- DevOps Transformation (CI/CD, repo modularization, K8s)
- Ruby on Rails Delivery (pipelines, scaling, TDD)
- Quality Engineering (test automation, metrics)
